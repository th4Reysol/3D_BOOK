        <h1>My Favorite Footballers</h1>

        <p>
            This book features footballers around the world with whom I am impressed.<br>
            Hopefully you would love them too.
        </p>
        <p>Here are players whom this book covers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lionel Messi</li>
            <li>Christiano Ronaldo</li>
            <li>Neymar</li>
            <li>Gareth Bale</li>
            <li>Robert Lowandowski</li>
            <li>Harry Kane</li>
            <li>Karim Benzema</li>
            <li>Erling Haarand</li>
            <li>Kylian Mbappe</li>
            <li>Ronaldo</li>
            <li>Kaoru Mitoma</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Through the book, you can see more players other than them above.</p>
        <p>
            I pick up their great performances as well as their career pathes. <br>
            I hope that it would be useful when you talk about or discuss soccer players.
        </p>
