            <h1 class="plname">Lionel Messi</h1>
            <p class="player">Everyone at least knows Lionel Messi by name even though they are not familiar with soccer. 
            I was one of them before I started watching him and noticed that he is one of the best players ever in the soccer history.
            After he joined Barcelona, one of the most dominant club in Spain, Messi won so many titles for the club.
            La Liga, Champions League and Copa Del Ray, he won these trophies as well as became the top goal scorer nearly every season and competition.
            Both his total goals and assists are now the club's untouchable records. 
            From 2021-22 season, he has played for a French mega club Paris Saint-Germain.
            This year, he won his first FIFA World Cup title for Argentina, which was the last trophy that had eluded him for almost 20 years.

            <p class="player">
                When you talk with somebody about soccer, you will discuss this question: "Which is the best footballer, Messi and Christiano Ronaldo?"
            Christiano Ronaldo is definitely one of the best players ever as well as the greatest in his home country Portugal.
            He established himself in England's great powerhouse Manchester United and moved to Spain's Real Madrid, a rival club against Barcelona.
            Christiano Ronaldo scored 451 goals in 438 league matches, the most in Real Madrid's history. He also brought so many trophies to Madrid, especially the Chanpions League titles in the third competition running from 2016 to 2018.
            Moving to Italy's Juventus, he marked over 100 goals with three seasons, winning a Serie A title for the club. Following the second spell in Manchester United, this year, he moved to a Middle East club Al Nassr.

            <h1 class="plname">Robert Lewandowski</h1>
            <p class="player">
                As mentioned above, Messi and Christiano Ronaldo made so great performances in the Spanish top tier league that either of them won the Ballon d'Or for a decade.
                It means that footballers missed out on this once-in-a-life honor.
                Robert Lewandowski, in fact, also shined in the German Bundesliga to become the top scorer for the fourth season running.
                During these campaign, he hit a new single-season high of 41 goals with Bayern Munich, which had been unbreakable for some 40 years.

            <h1 class="plname">Kaoru Mitoma</h1>
            <p class="player">
                I cannot stop talking about him because I am Japanese. Kaoru Mitoma, a debutant in the English Premier League, made it happen in the round of 16 for the FA Cup trophy.
                His winning goal was a big surprise to Brighton and a painful shock to Liverpool. You can watch the moment on Brighton's YouTube Channel. I hope that Mitoma will win the trophy with his goals.
                There are speculations around this Japan's winger that several teams try to land him with a big deal, paying for his transfer fee. 
                You cannot miss out on his future.
